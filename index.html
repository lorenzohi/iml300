        <p>Week 2 Reading:</p>

        Before this reading I had not put much thought into what colors in software could represent and how a disparity in social statuses based solely on race could be so ingrained into our society that even new softwares were made with this in mind. On the other hand reading this piece it does not surprise me knowing how unaccessible that creativity was in the 1940s especially when pertaining to a career. The concept of Silicon Valley in general is a dream but it is this dream that when applied to a society founded upon racist ideals has made this make believe world of limitless creativity to expand only within a white cisgendered vacuum. This is what makes me happy seeing computer science and many other arts being taught and made accessible in low income communities, the freedom to create art is so important.

        <p>Discussion Questions:</p>

        - Are Silicon Valley industries taking action against systemic racial oppression?
        - What tech software is known for consistently branding a black interface?
        - Why is black many times seen as the absence of color when it is the opposite?


        <p>Week 3 Reading:</p>

        Initially this reading was very interesting, seeing all the different social spaces that were created on the internet and the general eagerness that filled all these VHS tape tutorials and chat rooms. I think at the internet’s conception people were definitely excited by this newfound connection to many people in the world, where it seems like now there are less random interactions on the internet that are not filled by political discourse. Lots of these connections have been severed by disbelief in facts and reliance on beliefs. This article reminds me of how fun Instagram was when I first made mine without my parents knowing; filming ALS ice bucket challenges with my friends, giving random classmates a TBH, or even just using fun built in filters even though in retrospect they were hideous. It’s these interactions that make me as sad as the author when remembering this distant internet social climate.

        <p>Discussion Questions:</p>

        - What is the key to finding these new social spaces apart from the usual instagram and twitter?
        - Is there somewhere to find more archival early internet media?
        - What do you think tiktok, being the newest form of mainstream social media is doing to the authors claim of saying there is not enough naive socializing on the internet?

        <p>Week 5 Reading:</p>
        This talk by Lauren McCarthy was extremely interesting when talking about the concept of literal followers. It’s a really strange feeling of wanting to be seen but not wanting to interact or socialize. Some would compare this to the modern age of Instagram social norms. I am not sure how I would feel by being followed but it is a really interesting idea and seeing what type of people would participate in this interests me.
        Her smart home project, ‘Lauren,’ was such an experimental take to the idea of smart home systems. To know that you are being watched at by an actual human that can learn and have feelings. But understanding how these systems work really gave me a value for privacy; seeing what good can be accomplished in the murder case where amazon recordings helped the case they were forming, but on the other hand seeing that New York Times piece about how these smart homes are becoming a tool for domestic abuse. This dynamic does create a power imbalance if used in an unstable home.

        <p>Discussion Questions:</p>

        - How do these new smart homes cross boundaries of privacy?
        - What is being done to balance these different spins of social surveillance programs with safety and privacy?
        - What are other examples of work like the followers program Lauren McCarthy spoke about?

        <p>Week 6 Reading:</p>
        When reading this piece I was immediately interested by the concept of the poor image, something I had always known of in the back of my mind but never really processed what it could mean in terms of hierarchal norms in media distribution. I was intrigued at accessibility/democratization of the poor image and how often these poor images lend themselves more to deeper cultural conversations and analysis. It was also interesting to see how cinema is often treated as the flagship store for rich imagery and while this is great common people are not always going to be able to access this form of imagery in its original form which is dependent on socioeconomic status, the environment you live in, among other reasons.

        <p>Discussion Questions:</p>

        - How has social media affected our perception of the poor image?
        - Are there any media makers that make art in lower quality intentionally?
        - With media being more and more accessible everyday how did the form of image ripping begin?

        <p>Week 7 Ted Talk:</p>

        This ted talk was super educational to me, seeing Joy Buolamwini talk about algorithmic bias and where this is rooted in was interesting. I think many who are quick to criticize companies (ie: me) about biases should watch this piece to learn how we can combat this issue and the real danger that this poses. Seeing how the ai training is the main issue it was a real call to action to the next generation of software developers especially at the very end of the talk. Understanding this bias and how it has really large legal implications helped me realize the severity of the issue especially as our society develops more legal systems that implement facial recognition software without developing inclusive and diverse training systems. I think this also shows how many of these teams creating these softwares are not diverse either, yet another example of how affirmative action is important to the workplace and can prevent things like this happening (ie: having more developers of color to test these softwares on before they are released and spread).

        <p>Discussion Questions: </p>

        - What software companies are actively trying to dismantle these cisgendered predominantly white workplaces?
        - What are the worst effects that the implementation of facial recognition softwares have had on our society?
        - How has Apple as a company with their Face ID tech had an impact on this software? How much have they contributed to the development of the software?

        <p>Week 8 Reading Response:</p>
        The reading and Ted Talk were amazing to engage with, learning how data can have a negative effect on minorities and the power dynamic that a lot of media can play into. Hearing Adichie speak about her experience as a Nigerian immigrant and how her roommate’s perception of Africans was completely shaped by Western media and it is this media that creates a power dynamic in this case from a white American to a black Nigerian. This was very interesting when Adichie went on to share how her perception of Mexican people and immigrants was completely formed by western media as well, this was so important to learn that many individual problems and people that think stereotypes are true many times are rooted in a greater systemic issue.
        The reading was also very engaging to see the writer talk about different forms of violence that I honestly never thought to be ‘violence’. It was very inspiring to see companies like p5.js that truly care about every impact that their company makes on society both environmentally and socially.

        <p>Discussion Questions:</p>

        - What is Glitch doing to combat all forms of violence much like p5.js?
        - How can society shift from national media many times coming from the west to more international media?
        - How can coding specifically tie into combatting only telling a singular story much like Adichie mentioned?

        <p>Week 11 Reading:</p>
        I really enjoyed this talk by Ari Melenciano and the way that she says that she tries to make each project interdisciplinary because many times when works are not they can leave in blind spots and because of this they do not have the social impact they otherwise would. I also really enjoyed how she prioritizes thinking about technology through a lens of the natural world and how there are many sophisticated technologies in the preexisting world around us.
        I appreciate her also talking about obsoletion and how huge companies like Apple are very good at creating obsolete technologies and ultimately wasteful design. This is true especially when it comes to flagship smartphones which Apple releases every single year.

        <p>Discussion Questions:</p>

        - What can we do to simultaneously advance our technologies while not creating excessive waste?
        - What challenges do ecological design pose for producers/consumers?
        - How do we ensure that using natural materials is done in a way that does not exploit marginalized groups (ie: labor workers)?
