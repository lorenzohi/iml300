With this project I wanted to create an informational website on how latiné communities can take responsibility for anti-black sentiments that are oftentimes never spoken about, acknowledging where these sentiments come from and an educational way to correct them with a target audience of the older latiné generation. I wanted to speak about POC solidarity and the myths that surround this concept and how even in POC spaces black individuals are still facing oppressive forces.
Originally this project was going to be entirely informative but while developing I tried to think of a way to honor the afro-latiné intersection and I have always loved creative collective websites and thought I would develop a framework of my own.
I created the directory with the hope that while educating on issues that directly affect black communities and latiné communities (in different ways) that there could also be a resource to take positive action in mitigating racism within POC communities.
