    <p class = "p1">When speaking about fashion influences and aesthetic exchanges between black and brown communities is to know differences between respectful appreciation and appropriation. Knowing the history behind certain styles especially when it comes to black hair is so important. POC communities must realize that there is a clear divide between the communities and that some styles are not to be participated in when outside of these communities. </p>
