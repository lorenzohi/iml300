    <p1 class="p1">June of 2020 was a major time of revealing the way that many Americans think of Black Americans largely because of the Black Lives Matter movement, a movement that has always existed but only taken on this organization name since 2016. Many had a false perception of what this movement was actually about, Latinés included. In the article written for NBC News by Nirma Hasty, she points out, "A misconception among Latinos and others is that Black Lives Matter is 'about trying to put Black people first, as supposed to looking at Black Lives Matter as a human rights platform,' Hernandez said."</p1>
