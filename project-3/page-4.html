    <h1 class="title">community proximity</h1>
    <h2 class="descript">solidarity & division</h2>
    <p1 class="p1">In some cases we see how in communities of both black and brown populations that this proximity can lead to association. Sometimes creating an environment where culture is equally shared in a space leading to a cultural melting pot. All of this can be good until we consider the reclaiming of slurs/stereotypes by races or ethnicities that have had them used against them. </p1>
    <p class="p2">It is important for latinés to realize that solidarity and division can happen at the same time, especially when we consider culturally precious styles and ways of speaking. AAVE and spanglish have an intersection but being aware of why this is happening is important.
        With latinés casually using the n-slur in music and in real life we really see how many do not understand or choose to ignore the history of antiblackness in our world and how it still plagues modern society.</p>
